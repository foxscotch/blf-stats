# blf-stats

uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah just reads some stuff from the blf stats page

the day-to-day statistics are kind of hard to work with in particular so
basically i want to just snatch all that data and do my own thing

it currently continues indefinitely, so you'll need to ctrl+c stop it after you
get what you want lol

depends on:

- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- lxml (for bs4)
